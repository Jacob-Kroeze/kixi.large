# kixi.large

This is a fork of docjure to work better with tech.ml.dataset. It
needs to keep in sync with the version of POI that tmd is using. It
will probably do less, and slightly differently from docjure, thus it
is only large, not XL.

## Usage

This is really for internal use, but might be of use to you.
